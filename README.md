## Project Overview
The project builds a dynamic webpage that accepts user inputs (for date, City, State, Country, and Shape) in order to display information about UFO sightings worldwide.

## Results
When a user arrives at the webpage. They will see the following:

Based on their criteria, a results table is generated.

## Summary
One drawback of the webpage design is for the user to not have the all the available search options for all the parameters. For example, a drop down menu would allow the user more control over perhaps choosing a particular city from a list of available ones, rather than scrolling through the table.
